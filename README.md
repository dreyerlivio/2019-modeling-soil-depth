# 2019-Modeling distributed soil depth maps using different methods
This repository contains three scripts to produce distributed soil depth maps. The Ordinary_regression_kriging.r script interpolates soil depths based on ordinary and regression kriging, the Random_forest.r script uses the random forest classification method and the GIST.py script predicts soil depth by using a geomorphological index approach based on Catani et al. ( 2010). User need to provide their own input data, which requires soil depth observation points for the model calibration and validation and certain covariates in a raster format. A detailed description of the methods as well as an application of the methods in a Swiss mountainous are found in the Documention.pdf file.
